# Toolkit Integration Reset Journey

## Background - Week of Wrong Abstractions

After a week of integration work, we discovered a fundamental problem: instead of exposing the rpg-toolkit's API directly to UE, we had built custom orchestration and convenience layers that hid the actual toolkit from the user.

**What we built wrong:**
- Custom entity management system (not in toolkit)
- Convenience functions like `RollWithAdvantage` (not in toolkit)  
- Only ~13% of dice package exposed
- 0% of core package actually exposed
- User couldn't see what the toolkit actually provides

**User feedback:**
> "how am i supposed to know what i need to orchestrate if you're not giving me the toolkit as i intended to use it"

**The core issue:** User needs to see the raw toolkit to make informed decisions about what orchestration patterns to build on top of it.

## New Integration Philosophy - Expose Everything Public

**Rule:** Every public method/function/constant/type in toolkit gets:
1. C binding in Go
2. UE function in subsystem
3. Blueprint accessibility

**No editorial decisions** about what's "useful" - expose everything and let user discover through usage.

**Benefits:**
- User can test individual toolkit functions in isolation
- Debug at toolkit level, not wrapper level  
- Build confidence incrementally in toolkit behavior
- Make informed decisions about orchestration patterns

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Delete Wrong Implementation ‚ùå
- Remove custom entity management from core_bindings.go
- Remove convenience functions from URPGDiceSubsystem
- Remove orchestration logic we invented

### Phase 2: Expose Actual Core Package üéØ
**6 Error Constants:**
- ErrEntityNotFound, ErrInvalidEntity, ErrDuplicateEntity
- ErrNilEntity, ErrEmptyID, ErrInvalidType

**EntityError Struct:**
- NewEntityError function
- Error() method, Unwrap() method

**Entity Interface:**
- GetID() method, GetType() method

### Phase 3: Expose Complete Dice Package üé≤
**Roller Interface:**
- CryptoRoller struct, Roll/RollN methods
- SetDefaultRoller function

**Roll Struct:**
- NewRoll, NewRollWithRoller functions
- GetValue, Err, GetDescription methods

**Helper Functions:**
- D4, D6, D8, D10, D12, D20, D100

### Phase 4: Full UE Integration üèóÔ∏è
- URPGCoreSubsystem: Core errors + EntityError + Entity interface
- URPGDiceSubsystem: Complete dice API (~15+ functions)
- All functions Blueprint accessible
- Handle-based memory management for safety

### Phase 5: Validation Testing üß™
**Test scenarios:**
- Use each toolkit function individually
- Verify toolkit behavior matches expectations  
- Test error cases and edge conditions
- Validate memory management works correctly

## Success Criteria

**Complete Exposure:**
- [ ] Core package: 100% of public API accessible in UE
- [ ] Dice package: 100% of public API accessible in UE
- [ ] No custom orchestration or convenience layers

**User Empowerment:**
- [ ] User can see exactly what toolkit provides
- [ ] User can test toolkit functions in isolation
- [ ] User can make informed orchestration decisions
- [ ] User can debug at toolkit level, not wrapper level

## Expected Outcomes

1. **Toolkit Validation:** We'll discover which parts work well and which need improvement
2. **Usage Patterns:** User will discover natural orchestration patterns through direct usage
3. **Integration Confidence:** Both user and toolkit will be validated through direct testing
4. **Foundation for Growth:** Solid base for adding more toolkit modules (spatial, character, etc.)

## Key Learning

**Integration is about exposure, not abstraction.** The goal is to make the toolkit accessible in UE, not to make it "easier" by hiding complexity. The user needs to see the complexity to make good architectural decisions.

This journey represents a fundamental reset in integration approach - from "helpful abstractions" to "faithful exposure."
