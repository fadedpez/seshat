# Seshat Development Ideas & Optimizations

## Toolkit Update Pipeline Automation

### Current Workflow Issues
- Every toolkit update requires rebuilding Go → C DLL
- Every DLL update requires rebuilding UE solution in VS  
- Manual process creates friction for rapid iteration

### Potential Solutions to Explore

1. **Automated Build Pipeline**
   - Script that rebuilds Go DLL when toolkit changes
   - Automatically triggers UE build after DLL update
   - Single command for "update everything"

2. **Hot Reload Investigation**
   - Research if UE can hot-reload DLLs during development
   - Would eliminate need for full UE rebuilds during iteration
   - Faster development cycle

3. **Development vs Production Workflows**
   - Different build processes for dev iteration vs shipping
   - Maybe direct Go integration for dev, DLL for production?
   - Balance between speed and deployment simplicity

4. **CI/Build Integration**
   - Automated toolkit→UE builds in CI
   - Version management between toolkit updates and UE builds
   - Ensure compatibility across updates

### Why This Matters
- Toolkit is actively developed - frequent updates expected
- Manual rebuild friction will slow development velocity  
- Need seamless iteration between Go toolkit changes and UE testing
- The more friction in the pipeline, the less likely we are to iterate quickly

## Future Integration Ideas

### UE Go Toolkit - Standalone Plugin Project

**Vision**: Extract our Go→UE integration pattern into a standalone UE plugin that any developer can use to integrate Go libraries with Unreal Engine.

**What We'd Split Out:**
- **UE Plugin Framework**: Template subsystem + module setup patterns
- **Go Bindings Framework**: Standardized C export patterns and templates  
- **Build Pipeline**: Cross-compilation scripts and automation tools
- **Integration Documentation**: Step-by-step setup guides and best practices
- **Example Implementations**: Reference code showing common integration patterns

**Potential Project Structure:**
```
ue-go-toolkit/
├── Plugin/                    # Drop-in UE plugin template
│   ├── Source/GoToolkit/      # Subsystem framework & DLL management
│   └── Content/               # Blueprint examples & documentation
├── GoBindings/                # Go → C binding templates & patterns
├── Scripts/                   # Build automation & cross-compilation
├── Documentation/             # Integration guides & troubleshooting
└── Examples/                  # Reference implementations (dice, spatial, etc.)
```

**Value Proposition:**
- **For UE Developers**: Easy way to integrate any Go library into UE projects
- **For Go Developers**: Standard path to make Go libraries UE-accessible
- **For Community**: Bridges Go's growing ecosystem with UE's game development

**Implementation Path:**
1. Complete rpg-toolkit integration in Seshat (prove the pattern works)
2. Extract common patterns into generic templates
3. Create plugin structure with configurable bindings
4. Document setup process for arbitrary Go libraries
5. Publish as open-source UE plugin

**Why This Matters:**
- Go has excellent libraries for game logic, networking, AI, procedural generation
- UE excels at rendering, physics, editor tools, but C++ can be limiting for rapid logic development
- This bridge could unlock Go's ecosystem for the entire UE community
- Positions our integration work as broadly valuable, not just project-specific

**Success Metrics:**
- Other UE projects successfully integrate Go libraries using our plugin
- Community adoption and contributions to the plugin
- Documentation of successful integrations beyond rpg-toolkit
