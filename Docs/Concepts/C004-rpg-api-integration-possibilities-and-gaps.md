# C004: RPG-API Integration Possibilities and Gaps Analysis

**Date:** July 31, 2025  
**Purpose:** Comprehensive exploration of rpg-api capabilities, opportunities, and limitations  
**Status:** Discovery and Vision

## Executive Summary

After deep exploration of the rpg-api codebase, it's **significantly more sophisticated and complete than initially understood.** This isn't a basic API - it's a **full-featured D&D 5e gaming platform** with professional architecture, active development, and clear expansion paths.

**Key Discoveries:**
- **226+ commits in the last month** - very active development
- **Complete character creation workflow** with draft system, validation, and finalization
- **Equipment and inventory system** just implemented (latest commits)
- **Professional multi-layer architecture** with Proto-first design
- **Room generation system planned** with detailed ADRs and implementation strategy

## What's Currently Implemented and Working 🟢

### 1. Character Creation System (Production Ready)
**Complete Draft-Based Character Creation:**
```
Create Draft → Update Race/Class/Background → Roll/Assign Abilities → 
Select Skills → Choose Equipment → Validate → Finalize → Get Character
```

**Features:**
- **Progress tracking** with bitflags for completion state
- **Validation at each step** with detailed error messages  
- **Session management** with TTL and Redis persistence
- **Player ID support** for multi-user scenarios
- **Character finalization** using rpg-toolkit for stat calculations

**Client Commands Available:**
```bash
# Full workflow exists and works
rpg-api client create-draft --player-id "user123"
rpg-api client update-race --draft-id <id> --race RACE_HUMAN
rpg-api client update-class --draft-id <id> --class CLASS_FIGHTER
rpg-api client finalize-draft --draft-id <id>
rpg-api client list-characters --player-id "user123"
```

### 2. D&D 5e Data Integration (Complete)
**Dynamic Data Access via Local Database:**
- **Race/Subrace data** with traits, ability bonuses, language options
- **Class data** with features, proficiencies, spellcasting info
- **Background data** with skills, equipment, personality traits
- **Equipment database** with weapons, armor, gear, magical items
- **Spell database** with filtering by level, class, school
- **Concurrent loading** with caching for performance

**API Coverage:**
```cpp
// All of these exist and return real D&D data:
ListRaces() → Complete race data with subraces, traits, bonuses
ListClasses() → Class features, hit dice, proficiencies
ListBackgrounds() → Skills, equipment, personality options
ListEquipmentByType() → Weapons, armor, adventuring gear
ListSpells() → Spell database with descriptions and mechanics
```

### 3. Equipment and Inventory System (Just Completed!)
**Recent Implementation (Last Week's Commits):**
- **Equipment slots** (main hand, off hand, armor, accessories)
- **Inventory management** with quantity tracking, attunement
- **Encumbrance calculations** based on character stats
- **Custom item names** and modifications
- **Equipment type-specific data** (damage dice, AC bonuses, etc.)

### 4. Dice Rolling System (Full Featured)
**Session-Managed Dice Rolling:**
- **Notation-based rolling** ("3d6", "4d6 drop lowest", "2d8+3")
- **Roll history** with detailed results and timestamps
- **Session persistence** with Redis storage
- **Specialized ability score rolling** for character creation
- **Multiple rolling methods** (standard array, classic, heroic)

### 5. Professional Architecture Foundation
**Production-Ready Patterns:**
- **Proto-first API design** with versioned contracts (gRPC + HTTP)
- **Repository pattern** with Redis persistence layer
- **Orchestrator pattern** for complex business logic
- **Engine adapter** for external calculation libraries (rpg-toolkit)
- **External client** with concurrent data loading and caching
- **Comprehensive error handling** with structured error types
- **Docker deployment** with full stack orchestration

## Current Gaps and Missing Features 🔴

### 1. Character Creation Issues (Under Active Development)
**Choice-Based Architecture Migration:**
- **Current limitation**: System stores computed state instead of player choices
- **Problem**: Can't recreate character build decisions or handle validation properly
- **Solution in progress**: ADR-007 defines migration to choice-based system
- **Impact**: Affects character validation, customization, and progression

### 2. Room Generation System (Planned but Not Implemented)
**Spatial Gaming Features Missing:**
- **Room generation** handlers don't exist yet (ADRs define 4-phase plan)
- **Tactical positioning** system not built
- **Line of sight calculations** not implemented  
- **Multi-room coordination** not available
- **Entity placement** and spatial queries missing

**Note:** This is intentionally excluded per user request, but represents major gaming opportunity.

### 3. Combat System (Not Started)
**Core RPG Mechanics Missing:**
- **No initiative tracking** or turn management
- **No combat actions** (attack, cast spell, move)
- **No damage calculation** with resistances/immunities

- **No healing mechanics** or death saving throws

### 4. Spell System Limitations
**Spellcasting Mechanics:**
- **No spell slot management** for casters
- **No spell preparation** tracking
- **No concentration mechanics** 
- **No spell effect calculations**
- **No rest mechanics** (short/long rest recovery)

### 5. Performance and Scale Concerns
**Technical Debt:**
- **No pagination implemented** (TODO comments throughout codebase)
- **Limited caching strategy** beyond basic external API caching  
- **No rate limiting** or request throttling
- **Memory usage optimization** needed for large datasets
- **Concurrent request handling** needs improvement
