# Issue 8: Editor Crash Debugging Journey

## Initial Problem
- **Symptom**: UE Editor crashes when saving or stopping PIE
- **Error**: "Illegal references to private object" 
- **Impact**: Makes development impossible, blocks team collaboration

## Investigation Timeline

### Phase 1: Suspected DLL Loading Issues
**Initial Theory**: Cross-platform DLL paths causing crashes during shutdown

**Actions Taken**:
1. Fixed hardcoded DLL paths in `RPGDiceSubsystem.cpp`
   - Changed from: `Source/ThirdParty/RPGToolkit/rpg_toolkit.dll` 
   - Changed to: `Binaries/Win64/rpg_toolkit.dll` (using `FPlatformProcess::GetBinariesSubdirectory()`)
2. Added `RuntimeDependencies.Add()` to `Seshat.Build.cs`
3. Created proper `.gitignore` exception for DLL tracking

**Result**: âœ… Fixed team collaboration paths, but crashes persisted

### Phase 2: Subsystem Shutdown Safety
**Theory**: Function calls happening after subsystem cleanup during editor shutdown

**Actions Taken**:
1. Added shutdown guards to `RPGDiceSubsystem::PublishDiceRollEvent()`
   - Added `!bFunctionsLoaded` check
   - Removed error logging during shutdown (fail silently)
2. Updated `Roll()` and `RollForEntity()` functions to fail silently during shutdown
3. Verified `RPGEntitySubsystem` already had proper `bToolkitLoaded` guards

**Result**: ðŸ”„ Reduced potential crash sources, but root cause not found

### Phase 3: Path Configuration Discovery
**User Insight**: "Screenshots save directory is this: `../../../../../Projects/share/seshat/Seshat/Saved/Screenshots/WindowsEditor/`"

**Key Discovery**: UE project had corrupted absolute path settings that would break on other machines

**Root Cause Found**:
- **Config file corruption**: `DefaultEngine.ini` contained hardcoded absolute path:
  ```ini
  GameScreenshotSaveDirectory=(Path="D:/Projects/share/seshat/Seshat/Saved/Screenshots")
  ```
- **Cross-platform confusion**: Development on Linux WSL, runtime on Windows created path conflicts
- **"Illegal references to private object"**: UE trying to access files using broken absolute paths

### Phase 4: Industry Standard Fix Applied
**Solution**: Convert absolute paths to relative paths in config files

**Actions Taken**:
1. **Fixed screenshot path**:
   ```ini
   # Before: GameScreenshotSaveDirectory=(Path="D:/Projects/share/seshat/Seshat/Saved/Screenshots") 
   # After:  GameScreenshotSaveDirectory=(Path="Saved/Screenshots")
   ```
2. **Added proper Git configuration**:
   - Enhanced `.gitignore` with DLL exception: `!Binaries/Win64/rpg_toolkit.dll`
   - Created `.gitattributes` for binary file handling and line endings
   - Ensures `Saved/*` config corruption never gets committed

3. **Verified no other absolute paths** in config files via systematic grep search

## Technical Analysis

### Why This Caused "Illegal References to Private Object"
- UE tries to save/access files using the hardcoded `D:/Projects/...` paths
- On different machines or drive configurations, these paths don't exist or aren't accessible
- Windows access control treats missing/inaccessible paths as "private object" violations
- Results in access violation crashes during save operations

### Why Cross-Platform Development Created This Issue
- **Development Environment**: Linux WSL with `/home/frank/projects/...` paths
- **Runtime Environment**: Windows UE with `D:/Projects/...` paths  
- **Path Translation**: UE somehow converted between the two, creating invalid absolute references
- **Missing Safeguards**: No `.gitattributes` to prevent path corruption during Git operations

### Industry Best Practices Applied
1. **Relative Paths Only**: All committed config files use paths relative to project root
2. **Proper Git Configuration**: Binary files and line endings handled correctly
3. **Team Collaboration**: Any developer can clone to any location and it works
4. **Separation of Concerns**: Local user settings (in `Saved/*`) never committed to version control

## Lessons Learned

### CLAUDE.md Gaps Identified
- **Cross-Platform Development**: Need guidance for Linux development â†’ Windows runtime workflows
- **Path Management**: Best practices for UE project path handling across team environments  
- **Git Configuration**: Importance of `.gitattributes` for UE projects with binary assets

### Development Process Improvements
1. **Path Validation**: Always use relative paths in committed config files
2. **Cross-Platform Testing**: Verify project works when cloned to different directory structures
3. **Git Hygiene**: Proper binary file handling prevents subtle corruption issues
4. **Systematic Debugging**: Search for patterns (absolute paths) rather than assuming root causes

## Phase 5: Complete Root Cause Discovery
**User Insight**: "Content drawer path might be using WSL absolute path somehow?"

**Critical Breakthrough**: Found the exact source of the crashes

### Runtime Config File Analysis
Located the smoking gun in **runtime user settings**:
```
/home/frank/projects/share/seshat/Seshat/Saved/Config/WindowsEditor/EditorPerProjectUserSettings.ini
```

**Lines 1939-1949 contained broken relative paths**:
```ini
UNR=../../../../../Projects/share/seshat/Seshat/Content/
BRUSH=../../../../../Projects/share/seshat/Seshat/Content/
FBX=../../../../../Projects/share/seshat/Seshat/Content/
GenericSave=../../../../../Projects/share/seshat/Seshat/Content/
Level=../../../../../Projects/share/seshat/Seshat/Content/
```

These are the **import/export dialog paths** that UE uses during content save operations!

### Comprehensive Pattern Analysis
**Searched all crash logs** in `Saved/Crashes/` and found systematic pattern across **ALL crash reports**:

**Location**: `/home/funk/projects/share/seshat/Seshat/Saved/Crashes/UECC-Windows-*/Seshat.log`

**Found broken relative paths in**:
1. **Content save operations**: `../../../../../Projects/share/seshat/Seshat/Content/Untitled.umap`
2. **Asset registry cache**: `../../../../../Projects/share/seshat/Seshat/Intermediate/CachedAssetRegistry_*.bin`
3. **Source control**: `../../../../../Projects/share/seshat/Seshat/Saved/SourceControl/UncontrolledChangelists.json`
4. **Shader compilation**: `../../../../../Projects/share/seshat/Seshat/Intermediate/Shaders/WorkingDirectory/`
5. **DerivedDataCache**: `../../../../../Projects/share/seshat/Seshat/DerivedDataCache/DDC.ddp`

**Exact error message found**:
```
Can't save '../../../../../Projects/share/seshat/Seshat/Content/Untitled.umap': 
Illegal reference to private object: 'StaticMesh /Temp/Untitled_1_InstanceOf_/...'
```

### Complete Solution Strategy
**The fix**: Delete corrupted runtime config and cache files:

```bash
# Remove corrupted user settings (contains broken save dialog paths)
rm /home/frank/projects/share/seshat/Seshat/Saved/Config/WindowsEditor/EditorPerProjectUserSettings.ini

# Clear cache directories using broken paths
rm -rf /home/frank/projects/share/seshat/Seshat/Intermediate/
rm -rf /home/frank/projects/share/seshat/Seshat/DerivedDataCache/

# Clear any other corrupted engine settings
rm -f /home/frank/projects/share/seshat/Seshat/Saved/Config/WindowsEditor/Engine.ini
```

**When UE Editor restarts**: It will regenerate all these files with proper absolute Windows paths instead of the broken `../../../../../` relative path navigation.

## Current Status
- âœ… **Path Issues Fixed**: All absolute paths converted to relative paths in committed config
- âœ… **Team Collaboration Ready**: Project works regardless of clone location
- âœ… **Git Configuration**: Proper binary handling and DLL tracking
- âœ… **Shutdown Safety**: Added guards against function calls during cleanup
- âœ… **Root Cause Identified**: Runtime config corruption causing save dialog path issues
- ðŸ”„ **Testing Required**: Apply fix and verify crashes are resolved

## Next Steps
1. **Apply runtime config fix** (delete corrupted files, let UE regenerate)
2. **Test save functionality** with the fixed paths
3. **Verify no more crashes** during content save operations
4. **Document complete solution** for future reference

## Files Modified
- `Source/Seshat/RPGDiceSubsystem.cpp` - DLL path fixes + shutdown safety
- `Source/Seshat/Seshat.Build.cs` - RuntimeDependencies for DLL
- `Config/DefaultEngine.ini` - Fixed absolute screenshot path  
- `.gitignore` - Added DLL exception
- `.gitattributes` - Created for proper binary/text file handling
- `Documentation/issue-8-cross-platform-path-analysis.md` - Analysis document

## Key Insight
**The real issue wasn't the DLL loading or subsystem shutdown - it was corrupted absolute paths in UE config files causing "illegal references to private object" access violations during save operations.**

This is a classic example of how cross-platform development can introduce subtle configuration issues that only manifest during specific operations (like saving) rather than during normal runtime.
